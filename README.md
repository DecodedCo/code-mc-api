# Code, APIs and Prototyping Boilerplate Code

Use this code to connect your app to the fixer.io and Mastercard API Service

### fixer.io

Use [fixer.io](http://fixer.io/) to configure an API request with a base currency and a single target exchange rate symbol, and make sure to use `https://`, e.g. https://api.fixer.io/latest?base=USD&symbols=GBP

### Mastercard ATM Locations

Use the [Mastercard ATM Locations API](https://mastercard-locations.herokuapp.com/) to configure an API request centered around a location of interest.

### jQuery?

There are two versions of the code: `script.js` requires jQuery, whereas `script-no-jquery.js` does not.
